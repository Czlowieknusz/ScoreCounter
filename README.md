# ScoreCounter
App made in relation with Udacity android course


I added here some new methods I thought would improve the app.
You can find here:
- working onSaveInstaceState saving data that would be deleted after rotating a phone
- multi layouts
- Intents letting this app transfer through layouts, including putExtra letting pass data between them
- countDown timer allowing user to count time and add points in the same phone

Feel free to gather as much info from it as u want.
Hope u would find something interesting for U.
